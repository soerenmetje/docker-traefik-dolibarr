# Dolibarr
Setup for [**Dolibarr**](https://www.dolibarr.org/) running inside a **Docker Container** connected to [**Traefik:v2.0**](https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/) (reverse proxy). 

This setup is for an external webserver serving Dolibarr. Dolibarr will be available by a subdomain f. e. doli.domain.com. Corresponding certificates for **https** are atuomatically generated by Traefik. This ensures the secure data transmission. A **MariaDB** stores Dolibarrs' data persistently.

[tuxgasys' Dolibarr Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/tuxgasy/dolibarr) are used. Therefor Dolibarr will be installed automatically on first start.

```git clone https://github.com/soerenmetje/docker-traefik-dolibarr.git```
2. Traefik
